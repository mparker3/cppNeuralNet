Wanted to pass some time on a flight, prepare for an upcoming AI class, and keep my c++ sharp, so I decided to try my hand at implementing a simple XOR gate using a neural network. Following @miloharper's tutorial: https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1#.hjy9dav7z. Presented some fun challenges with "translation" from Python. I found that working in c++ required a greater understanding of the matrices and mathematics powering the neural net, because of the language's static, explicitly declared types.
