Wanted to pass some time on a flight, prepare for an upcoming AI class, and keep my c++ sharp, so I decided to try my hand at implementing a simple XOR gate using a neural network. Right now I just have the structure of a node, but the backpropogation algorithm is a joke - need to figure out how that actually works. I've heard good things about Andrew Ng's coursera tutorial for ML, so maybe I should watch that. Next steps right now: 

a) figure out backpropogation from a training data set

b) connect the node blueprint I have right now to other nodes, rather than static inputs

c) implement a "layer" class
